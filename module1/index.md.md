**What to look for**

You must inventory and assess your environment in the same way an adversary
would do reconnaissance, both from an internal and an external perspective. This
includes identifying all of the following:

-   Technologies

>   *What types of hardware is in use? What vendors? What types of software or
>   applications are used?*

-   IP Addresses and Sub-domains

>   *What are the network IPs, and domains, subdomains or hosting providers?
>   What ISPs are used?*

-   People

>   *Who are the network or system administrators? Who else may have elevated
>   privileges or access? How do people connect to the network?*

-   Content of Interest/Importance

-   Vulnerabilities

"All the business of war, and indeed all the business of life, is to endeavor to
find out what you don't know by what you do: that's what I called 'guessing what
was at the other side of the hill"

\~Duke of Wellington

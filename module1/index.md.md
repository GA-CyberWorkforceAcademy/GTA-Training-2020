**What to look for**

You must inventory and assess your environment in the same way an adversary
would do reconnaissance, both from an internal and an external perspective. This
includes identifying all of the following:

-   Technologies

-   IP Addresses and Sub-domains

-   People

-   Content of Interest/Importance

-   Vulnerabilities

"All the business of war, and indeed all the business of life, is to endeavor to
find out what you don't know by what you do: that's what I called 'guessing what
was at the other side of the hill"

\~Duke of Wellington

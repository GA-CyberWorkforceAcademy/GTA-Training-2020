Module 1 Overview
=================

>   Public sector organizations are major targets for cybersecurity attacks due
>   to the sensitive data they broker. In order to ensure information security
>   in the public sector, Congress has enacted legislation such as the Federal
>   Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), and its December 2014
>   update, Public Law 113-283. The requires agencies to develop, document, and
>   implement a program to provide information security for any information
>   systems and/or data used or handled in operations, to include what may be
>   managed by a third party.

>   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is a key element
>   in the implementation of FISMA. NIST has been charged with establishing a
>   cybersecurity framework consisting of standards, guidelines, and best
>   practices to help organizations to manage cybersecurity-related risk.

>   FISMA defines the term “information security” as meaning the protection of
>   information and information systems from unauthorized access, use,
>   disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide
>   integrity, confidentiality and availability. We must start with ensuring
>   that the principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability are
>   understood, applied and protected.

Before diving into the tasks that enable a cybersecurity professional to defend
an enterprise, the core fundamentals must be understood. This includes roles and
responsibilities, frameworks, policies, KSAs, and more.

**Module 2- Cyber Kill Chain Focus; External Threats.**

Understanding what you have is the first step towards forming a good defense.
Likewise, attackers begin with reconnaissance of their targets. By understanding
what assets an organization has, as well as how an adversary is accessing or
using that information, an organization can work towards a better risk
assessment and a more secure posture. This module will focus on how adversaries
conduct reconnaissance to gather information about assets, and identifying
vulnerabilities throughout a network.

**Module 3- Defense in Depth Focus; Internal (and External) Threats.**

Preparing a good defense within an organizationâ€™s perimeter is critical. When a
network/system is accessed, the level of controls and protection afforded
throughout a domain provide obstacles to slow the spread of a malware infection
or movement of an adversary. This allows the defense time to detect, protect and
eradicate threats. By identifying and categorizing assets and recognizing roles
and responsibilities, defense in depth can be implemented, evaluated and
improved upon. This module will focus on policy, roles and responsibilities,
risk assessment, and controls.
